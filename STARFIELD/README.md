# STAFRIELD OPTIMISED GRAPHICS

## GENERAL NOTE

Feel free to tinker with these settings however you please

From my experience I've found that Shadow quality and volumetric lighting had the largest impact on my framerate

There's a good video by hardwareunboxed on the performance impact of each setting

I also use a mod called "smooth ship reticle" which fixes the janky animation of the ship reticle

If you use this mod and still want steam achievements use this mod to enable them
https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/658

And if you want to launch into the starfield script extender from steam right click starfield and go to Properties > General > Launch options
and enter ```"location of modorganiser on your pc" "moshortcut://Starfield:Starfield" %command%```
this will make steam boot up the game with mods allowing you to still use steam overlay

## SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS




CPU : Intel core i5 12400F

GPU : Nvidea RTX 3060 12GB VRAM

RAM : 2x Corsair CM4X8GD3000C15K4 8GB DDR4 1066 MHz

Before making these optimisations my framarate would sit between 40-45 FPS and the frametime was very inconsistent causing laggy, slow and unresponsive gameplay.

## THE GOAL

The purpose of this config was to keep the framerate near enough glued to 60FPS while keeping a consistant frametime without sacrificing graphical quality.

## THE RESULTS

I was able to keep the FPS consistently on 60 with occasional drops to around 57FPS
